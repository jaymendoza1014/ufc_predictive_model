# UFC Fight Predictions

This project tests various machine learning models ability to predict outcomes on fights in the UFC. The three models used are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and a MLP Neural Network. A baseline was also established in order to evaluate the performance. The data used to train the models was accessed on Kaggle and webscraped from the UFC stats website. The baseline models accuracy was 59%. The models that produced the highest accuracy were the Logistic Regression and MLP Neural Network models at 66%. The Random Forest Model achieved 64%. 

The three models were used to predict the outcomes of the UFC 300 event that took place on 04/13/2024 and all of them were able to accuratley predict 5 out of 6 fights. The 6 fights the models predictions were based off of are included below each of the models evaluation of the dataset.

Enjoy!
